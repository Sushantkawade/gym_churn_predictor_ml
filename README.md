# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Membership Churn Prediction App  

A Flask-based web application that predicts whether a gym member is likely to **churn** (cancel their membership) based on details like age, membership type, attendance, payment history, and satisfaction score. The app uses a trained **machine learning model** to provide predictions and probability scores along with **top 3 reasons for churn**.

## 📊 Example Prediction  
**Input:**  
- Age: 23  
- Membership Type: Basic  
- Membership Length: 3 months  
- Avg Visits/Month: 20  
- Payment Delays: 2  
- Payment History: Mixed  
- Attendance: Regular  
- Satisfaction: 5/10  

**Output:**  
- Prediction: **Churn**  
- Probability: **99.97%**  
- Reasons: Low satisfaction, Payment delays, Short membership period
